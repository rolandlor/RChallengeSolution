I created a React application and I used create-react-app. The Dashboard / Admin page is in the public folder and the indexsecond.html file is the Dashboard / Admin page.
There is an index.html file in the src folder that contains the listings page.
It is possible to type a name in the field and after the button is clicked the table shows the result(s).
During the typing a table shows the names that contain the letter(s) that is/are on the field.
The pagination is missing from the listings page and the expandable row functionality is not working, but I would use bootstrap to create those tasks.
Unfortunately there is no other tab that contains my favorite gif / comic strip.
I don't have much experience in Redux so I didn't use it on this project.
